# Changing your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} plan on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #change_plan}

When you provision an instance, you select an IBM Cloud plan. You can change the plan later, if
needed. **Essentials** and **Standard** plans are available.
{: shortdesc}

The plan change operation shuts down and restarts the {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} application. Before you change plans, let your users know that the {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} application will be shutting down and advise them to log off.
{: important}

1. Go to the UI where you manage your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance. For more information, see [Managing your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance](/docs/openpages?topic=openpages-manage_op_instance).
2. Click **Plan**.
3. Click the plan that you want to use.
4. Click **Save**.

The plan change is not reflected in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user interface for approximately 30 minutes. {: .note}
