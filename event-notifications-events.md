# Enabling event notifications for {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}
{: #event-notifications-events}



As an administrator of {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}, you might want to send notifications of events in {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} to other users, or human destinations, by using email, SMS, or other supported delivery channels. Additionally, you might want to send these notifications of events to other applications to build logic by using event-driven programming that uses webhooks, for example. This is made possible by the integration between {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} and {{site.data.keyword.en_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

To send information to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, you must connect your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}. For more information about working with {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started).

## How events are collected and sent by {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}
{: #event-notifications-how}

When an event of interest takes place in your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance, {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} communicates with a connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to forward a notification to a [supported destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started#en-decide-event-destination).

Currently, {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} supports only email destinations.



## Events for {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}

## Enabling notifications
{: #event-notifications-enable}

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} service can be forwarded to an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance that is available in the same account. You can configure only one {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance to one {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance. However, a single {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance can have many {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instances pointing to it.

The following table shows the {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} service instance regions and the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service regions that they can forward events to:
| {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} service instance region | Supported {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service region |
| --- | --- |
| AWS US East ( us-east-1 ) |  IBM Cloud Dallas ( us-south ) |
