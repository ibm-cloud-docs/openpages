# Auditing events for {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}
{: #at_events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see the [getting started tutorial for {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} service are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch).

## Analyzing events
{: #at_events_iam_analyze}

<!-- Provide information about the events in your service that add additional information in requestData and responseData. See the IAM Events topic for a sample topic that includes this section: /docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-at_events_iam#at_events_iam_analyze.  -->
