If the group has users, it is created with the name and description you specified in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The group name is always prefixed by **Cloud IAM -** and is a subgroup under **Workflow, Reporting and Others** group.

Existing users that are added to the group in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
IAM are members of the group in {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} and the

## Creating a non-administrator user
{: #change3}

### Action in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
{: #action3}

Create a user with the following settings:
- Service: {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}
- Resources: An {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} service
- Roles and actions: {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} User, Viewer, Editor, or Operator

### Outcome in {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}
{: #outcome3}

In {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}, the user is not a member of any groups by default.

The user is created with the User Name, Display Name, Email, and Group associations that you specified in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

The locale is U.S. English. In {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}, users and administrators can change a user’s locale. The synchronization job does not overwrite an existing user’s locale.

Users are assigned allowed profiles through their group associations. If a user has multiple allowed profiles, a preferred profile selection panel is displayed when the user logs in to {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} for the first time.

When a user has no other enabled profiles available, a fallback profile is used. A fallback profile allows a user who is either not associated with any profile, or whose profile is disabled or deleted, to log in to {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}.

When you are provisioning the service, you select the solutions that you want from a list. The first solution that you selected on the list determines which master profile is used as the fallback profile. For example, if you select the Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Financial Controls Management (FCM) solutions when you provisioned the service, the BCM Master profile is the fallback profile.

Users are assigned role templates through their group associations.
